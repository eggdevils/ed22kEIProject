Looked at Zach's game

Night at the Museum 
- looks super cool
- need ox collisers on things to make sure you don't fall through the floor
goal to add light sources and interactable exhibits
finding the museum thing and making it work
 
my game
- only have the room right now
- need to figure out how to get out of the doorframe 
- severance idea
